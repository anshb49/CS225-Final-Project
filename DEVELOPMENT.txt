Week 1: 11/16 - 11/30
    After developing the initial idea for the project, as a group, we started the week by simply
    cloning the repository and getting accustomed to the system by which we would have to push and
    pull files. Next, we began our actual work by trying to add out graph's data to the repository,
    so that as a group we could sift through it and make sense of all of the information in the form
    that it was given in. In developing a strategy for using the data, we realized that as a group we
    were uncomfortable with the way the information was distributed amongst various files, and not
    conviniently in a centralized location. Due to this, we decided to use a different data set instead
    (originally we were using data from Twitter, but we moved to Twitch data instead). This was a simple
    change, as we felt we were maintaining the integrity of our original project idea, but simply changed
    the specific set of data we were looking at. In order to maintain consistency, we changed our GOALS
    document to reflect these changes that we made, and communicated with our team staff mentor. For technical
    work, we added and familiarized ourselves with the graph class provided by the course staff for Lab_ML
    and started our project by writing a main.cpp file. We added a means to parse through the data 
    dilineated by commas in our CSV data files in order to make the data usable for the graph we plan to 
    construct. In order to make sure this worked, we added some basic test cases that verified that we were
    reading the right values in the corresponding locations in the vectors created for the data. Finally, 
    we wrote basic pseudocode for the implementation of the graph itself, as this reflected the goals that 
    we set for ourselves for the coming up week; we decided that to stay on schedule for the deadlines, we want
    to finish implementing the graph by the end of week 2, and also complete one of the two algorithms (if not
    both) that we are supposed to have done by the time of our mid-project meeting.
